## 3. Global Mixing Workflow

### Per Track
1. **Cleanup**
   - RX (if needed) → remove clicks, hiss
   - bx_cleansweep → remove unused low/high frequencies
2. **Corrective EQ**
   - TDR Nova → remove muddiness or harshness
3. **Compression**
   - GlueReeds1 → control dynamics
   - CamelCrusher (optional) → add warmth
4. **Additive EQ**
   - TDR Nova → enhance musical ranges
5. **Transient Control**
   - Transpire → emphasize attack for rhythmic clarity
6. **Effects**
   - Reverb (OldSkoolVerb/OrilRiver) via send
   - Delay/modulation sparingly
7. **Panning & Leveling**
   - Ensure each part has its own stereo space

Yes — we can refine this master chain so it works better in your context and also ensure it respects **broadcast/streaming loudness specs** while keeping your mix’s punch.

Here’s an updated, more precise version in **markdown**, optimized for your setup and tools:

---

## 🎛 Master Bus Chain

**1. Bus Compression — *Glue & Control***

* **Plugin**: ReaComp
* **Ratio**: `2:1`
* **Attack**: `30 ms` *(lets transients through)*
* **Release**: `100–150 ms` *(musical recovery)*
* **Gain Reduction**: `-1 to -2 dB` *(light, just for glue — not heavy compression)*
* **Tip**: Engage only when the mix feels slightly “disconnected,” otherwise skip.

---

**2. Global EQ — *Tonal Polish***

* **Plugin**: TDR Nova
* Use gentle, broad EQ moves only:

  * Low-shelf: `+0.5 to +1 dB @ 60–80 Hz` *(if low end feels thin)*
  * High-shelf: `+0.5 to +1 dB @ 12–14 kHz` *(adds air if mix is dull)*
  * Small cuts (`-1 to -2 dB`) in 200–400 Hz range if muddy.
* Avoid boosting more than `+1.5 dB` in any band at this stage.

---

**3. Saturation — *Glue & Harmonics***

* **Plugin**: FerricTDS
* **Drive**: `+0.5 to +1.0 dB` *(very subtle)*
* **Recovery**: Medium
* Purpose: Adds light harmonic content and “rounds” transients without audible distortion.

**4. Limiting — *Final Loudness & Safety***

* **Output**: `-1.0 dB`

  * Keeps True Peak safe for streaming (Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music).

* **Threshold**: adjust until your **Youlean Loudness Meter** shows your target LUFS:

  * `-14 LUFS` → good for streaming without normalization penalties.
  * `-9 to -8 LUFS` → modern pop/rock loud, but with less dynamic range.

* **Link**: **On** (so L/R stay balanced).

* **Target Gain Reduction**: ideally `2–4 dB` max on peaks.

  * If you’re hitting `6 dB+` regularly, back off — it will squash transients too much.

**Example workflow**:

1. Set **Output** first (`-1.0 dB`).
2. Play your loudest section.
3. Lower **Threshold** until the integrated LUFS hits your target.
4. Verify with Youlean that **True Peak** never exceeds `-1 dB`.

**5. Loudness Check — *Final Verification***

* **Plugin**: Youlean Loudness Meter
* **Check**:

  * **Integrated LUFS** (overall loudness)
  * **Short-term LUFS** (avoid sudden overs)
  * **True Peak** (should stay below -1 dB)
* If your mix sounds squashed, **back off** the limiter threshold and revisit the bus compression.

💡 **Important**:
Mastering is *subtle* — the goal is **translation** across devices, not drastically changing your mix. If you find yourself EQ’ing heavily, go back to the mix stage and fix it there instead.

## 4. Genre-Specific Notes (Fast Brazilian Music)
- **Clarity first:** avoid overlapping frequency ranges between instruments
- **Transient shaping:** keep rhythmic elements distinct
- **Stereo placement:** pan to prevent masking
- **Dynamic range:** avoid over-compression to keep groove energy
