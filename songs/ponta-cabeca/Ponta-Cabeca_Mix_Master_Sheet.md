## 4. Special Mix Notes
- Keep reverbs short to avoid clouding fast rhythmic passages.
- Transient shaping on snare and percussion is essential for articulation.
- Use stereo widening on overheads only subtly to keep phase coherence.

## 5. Automation / FX Ideas
- Light delay throws on vocal phrases for interest (use NastyDLA).
- Automate guitar high-mid boost during solos for more cut.
- Ride bass volume during breaks to maintain balance.
