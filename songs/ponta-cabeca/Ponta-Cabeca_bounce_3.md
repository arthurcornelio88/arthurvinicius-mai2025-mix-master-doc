# Bounce 3 – Mix Notes

## Guitar
- Reduce overall reverb send by approximately 2–3 dB to prevent excessive ambience.
- Check for passages with volume leaks or spikes:
  - Use light volume automation or clip gain adjustments before compression to smooth inconsistencies.

## Bass
- Reduce nasal and metallic tone:
  - Lower upper-midrange (around 800 Hz – 1.5 kHz) by ~1–2 dB with a narrow EQ band.
  - Reduce excessive clickiness above ~3–4 kHz if present using a gentle low-pass or high-shelf cut.
  - On **Bass Pro** or SansAmp, slightly turn the Mid knob counterclockwise and reduce Drive to minimize harsh harmonics.
- Preserve warmth and body between 80–120 Hz for groove, ensuring the low end remains tight and controlled.
- Consider using a darker cabinet IR (e.g., Ampeg 1x15) to reduce metallic resonance while keeping attack definition.
- ReaComp adjusted
