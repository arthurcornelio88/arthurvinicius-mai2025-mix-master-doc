# Bounce 2 – Mix Notes (Revised Order)

## General Feedback
The first bounce has been reviewed, and here are the consolidated suggestions from the musicians for the second bounce.

---

## 1. Timing & Editing
- On the **third bass note** at the beginning of the song, it is slightly late — align it with the kick drum for tightness (even if it’s “cheating”).

---

## 2. Tonal & Dynamic Adjustments
### Kick Drum
- There were difficulties in achieving kick definition due to the original drum quality.
- Consider boosting **some higher frequencies** to make the **attack clearer** — test if it improves presence without making it harsh.
- EQ and Exciter

### Snare Drum
- Maybe try un **exciter** for space and dynamic differentiation.
- If not good, just config the compressor

### Bass
- The bass is lacking a bit of color — try adding an **amp simulator** (e.g., SVT or Bassman).
- Lower the **bass volume slightly** in the mix.

### Acoustic Guitar
- Add an **acoustic guitar amp simulator** to enhance warmth, dynamics, and presence.
  - **Recommended options**:
    - **Free**:
      - **AmpliTube 5 CS** (IK Multimedia) – includes basic but high-quality acoustic presets.
      - **LePou Plugins** (LeCab + clean amp) – open-source, lightweight.
    - **Paid**:
      - **Acoustic Guitar Suite by Positive Grid** (BIAS FX 2) – detailed, realistic amp and mic emulation.
      - **Fishman Aura Spectrum DI** (hardware/software hybrid) – professional-grade acoustic imaging.
- Apply subtle EQ shaping after the amp sim to avoid over-coloration.

---

## 3. Volume Balancing
- Raise **vocal volume slightly** for better presence.

---

## 4. Spatialization & Effects
### General Reverb
- Add **a bit of reverb** to the **vocal mics**, **overheads**, and **guitar** to give the mix more depth; it currently feels too dry.
- Consider a slightly **more pronounced reverb** on vocals and guitar for extra warmth and space.

### Special Reverb (Instrumental Section)
- In the **instrumental section before the last part**, try adding a **shimmer reverb** (e.g., Valhalla Supermassive) to the guitar to clearly mark the contrast with the sung sections and make the guitar the central focus. This is experimental — only if it works musically.
