# Bounce 2 – Mix Notes (Revised Order)

## General Feedback
The first bounce has been reviewed, and here are the consolidated suggestions from the musicians for the second bounce.

---

## 1. Timing & Editing
- On the **third bass note** at the beginning of the song, it is slightly late — align it with the kick drum for tightness (even if it’s “cheating”).

---

## 2. Tonal & Dynamic Adjustments
### Kick Drum
- There were difficulties in achieving kick definition due to the original drum quality.
- Consider boosting **some higher frequencies** to make the **attack clearer** — test if it improves presence without making it harsh.
- EQ and Exciter

### Snare Drum
- Maybe try un **exciter** for space and dynamic differentiation.
- If not good, just config the compressor

### Bass
- The bass is lacking a bit of color — try adding an **amp simulator**
  You can use **Guitar Rig 7 – Bass Pro** for a Brazilian funk / slap style with occasional long notes, slightly aggressive but still warm.

  **Recommended Guitar Rig 7 configuration:**
  - **VC 76 Compressor (1176 style)**:
    - Attack: ~3 (fast but not too tight, keeps slap pop)
    - Release: ~7 (fast release for groove rebound)
    - Ratio: 4:1 or 8:1 (depending on desired control)
    - Input: Adjust for ~3–5 dB gain reduction during slap
    - Output: Balance to match project level
    - Dry: ~30% for parallel compression feel

  - **Graph EQ (inside Bass Pro)**:
    - 40 Hz: -2 dB (reduce unnecessary boom)
    - 90 Hz: +1 dB (low punch)
    - 180 Hz: 0 dB
    - 300 Hz: -1 dB (clean low-mids)
    - 500 Hz: 0 dB
    - 1 kHz: +2 dB (slap attack definition)
    - 2 kHz: +1 dB (clarity)
    - 4 kHz: 0 dB
    - 10 kHz: +2 dB (subtle brightness)

  - **Bass Pro Amp Section**:
    - Ultra Lo: OFF
    - Ultra Hi: ON
    - Gain: ~11 h
    - Bass: ~12 h
    - Mid: ~2 h
    - Mid Freq: ~800 Hz
    - Treble: ~1 h
    - Drive: ~9 h (slight grit)
    - Master: Adjust to mix

  - **Bass Pro Cabinet**:
    - Room: ~60% (adds space)
    - A/B Switch: B (more open)

  - **Solid EQ (post-amp)**:
    - Low Gain: Cut slightly if bass dominates
    - Mid Gain: Boost slightly at 1–2 kHz for more attack
    - High Gain: +1 dB max for clarity

- Lower the **bass volume slightly** in the mix after processing.


### Acoustic Guitar
- Add an **acoustic guitar amp simulator** to enhance warmth, dynamics, and presence.
  - **Recommended options**:
    - **Free**:
      - **AmpliTube 5 CS** (IK Multimedia) – includes basic but high-quality acoustic presets.
      - **LePou Plugins** (LeCab + clean amp) – open-source, lightweight.
    - **Paid**:
      - **Acoustic Guitar Suite by Positive Grid** (BIAS FX 2) – detailed, realistic amp and mic emulation.
      - **Fishman Aura Spectrum DI** (hardware/software hybrid) – professional-grade acoustic imaging.
- Apply subtle EQ shaping after the amp sim to avoid over-coloration.

---

## 3. Volume Balancing
- Raise **vocal volume slightly** for better presence.

---

## 4. Spatialization & Effects
### General Reverb
- Add **a bit of reverb** to the **vocal mics**, **overheads**, and **guitar** to give the mix more depth; it currently feels too dry.
- Consider a slightly **more pronounced reverb** on vocals and guitar for extra warmth and space.

### Special Reverb (Instrumental Section)
- In the **instrumental section before the last part**, try adding a **shimmer reverb** (e.g., Valhalla Supermassive) to the guitar to clearly mark the contrast with the sung sections and make the guitar the central focus. This is experimental — only if it works musically.

* [ ] Add amp sim to acoustic guitar for warmth, with light EQ.
* [ ] Raise vocal volume slightly.
* [ ] Add subtle reverb to vocals, overheads, and guitar.
* [ ] Test shimmer reverb on the pre-final instrumental guitar section.
